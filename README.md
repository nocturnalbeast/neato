# neato

Neato is a system maintenance appplication built for Windows operating systems. This is a Python project and still is a work in progress.

What sets Neato apart from the others on the scene?

  *Neato is portable, and does not require an install. 

  *Neato cleans junk files from over 3000 known applications, using the Winapp2 database.

  *Neato uses a clean, minimal UI, designed for ease-of-use.

Neato is still a work in progress, many more things have to be implemented. This repository actually is for the second version of Neato. You heard it right. Neato is undergoing a huge revamp from the cluttered, spaghetti-code-like implementation of neato 1.x, thus making this project one of my favorites. Although many more things have to be implemented, I will work on this project in my free time. Since that resource is limited to me now, it'll take some time to get a fully working build with the proposed features.

You can contribute to this project by forking this project and helping out with parts of the engine, translations(multiple lang support to be implemented) and much more. Simply shoot me an email and I'll help you out.
